# Power Optimization & Reliability (Telecom)

This folder collects **public-safe** summaries of work related to power modeling, UPS strategy, and energy efficiency.

## Suggested Artifacts (add real ones as allowed)
- Diagrams (`diagrams/`): .drawio exports and PDFs
- Calculations (`calcs/`): load tables, assumptions, safety factors
- Narratives (`docs/`): problem → approach → outcome, with metrics

## Example Narrative (template)
- **Problem:** Reduce site power draw by X% while maintaining uptime
- **Approach:** Load inventory → scenario modeling → UPS sizing → rollout
- **Impact:** Achieved X% reduction; improved MTBF; compliant with NEC sections [redacted]
