## Structure

- `AICoPilot/` – AI compliance & proposal co-pilot (prompting + Python scaffolding)
- `WeeklyStatusGem/` – Generates weekly status reports from calendar exports
- `Compliance-Automation/` – Templates for policy mapping, RACI, and SOC-style controls
- `PowerOptimization/` – Telecom/power engineering artifacts, diagrams, and narratives
- `AI-ML-Labs/` – ML labs & experiments (to be expanded during GWU D.Eng.)

> Tip: You can keep this as a **monorepo** or create **one repo per folder**. See **Setup** below.

## Quick Start

1. Create a new GitHub repo (public or private), e.g. `portfolio`.
2. Upload the contents of this folder.
3. Update each `README.md` with **specifics** (metrics, dates, screenshots, redacted docs).
4. If you want a simple site, enable **GitHub Pages** with the `docs/site` folder.

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial portfolio"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo>.git
git push -u origin main
```

## What Hiring Teams Look For

- **Evidence**: working code, prompts, notebooks, diagrams
- **Clarity**: problem statements, architecture, and outcomes
- **Impact**: metrics, scale, reliability, compliance improvements
- **Communication**: READMEs that explain the why/how/what
